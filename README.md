# AvrDDS
ATmega88 based DDS signal generator from 2013

Old. Simple. And almost without analog part. One of my first AVR devices. It was constructed before I had passed 
[MIT 6.002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/index.htm) 
course. Published here as an artifact of my home made electronics.
